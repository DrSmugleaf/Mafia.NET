name: "Town Power"
description: "Town Power roles are a bit of a catch-all category, with all of the roles other than Spy falling into another category as well. The three non-Spy roles (Bus Driver, Jailor and Veteran) are all able to take action upon another player at night, either in the form of switching a player's location at night to keep them out of harm's way, imprisoning, interrogating, and executing a suspicious player, or killing anyone who visits one's house at night. In contrast, the Spy is a much more cerebral role which receives information about the Mafia / Triad's targets and which is able to read their otherwise inaccessible night chat in the hope of finding clues."
